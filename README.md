# Impact of Future Housing Developments in SF
The datasets we used are too big to be uploaded to github so here's a link to our google drive with the other two datasets (police data and housing valuation data): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SMC4WkD2eW3XPsLL0bv4m2UU1nkeua4O?usp=sharing

If you would like to avoid downloading all of the separate datasets: the `final_dataset.csv.zip` file in the notebooks folder contains the cleaned and merged data. You can then begin running the code in the `final_notebook.ipynb` file from section 2 (Baseline Model).
